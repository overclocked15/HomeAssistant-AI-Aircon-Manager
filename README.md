# AI Aircon Manager

A Home Assistant integration that uses AI (Claude or ChatGPT) to automatically manage your air conditioning system by intelligently adjusting zone fan speeds based on temperature sensors in each room. The goal is to bring your entire house to the desired temperature and maintain it efficiently.

## Features

### Core Capabilities
- **AI-Powered Management**: Uses Claude or ChatGPT to intelligently manage zone fan speeds
- **Multi-Room Support**: Configure multiple rooms with individual temperature sensors and zone controls
- **Temperature Equalization**: Automatically balances temperatures across all rooms
- **Smart Redistribution**: Increases fan speed in hot rooms, reduces in cold rooms to equalize
- **Main Aircon Fan Control**: Automatically adjusts your main AC unit's fan speed (low/medium/high) based on system needs
- **Automatic AC On/Off Control**: Can automatically turn your main AC on/off based on need with hysteresis
- **Automatic AC Temperature Control**: Can automatically control your main AC's temperature setpoint for fully hands-off operation
- **Comprehensive Diagnostics**: Detailed sensors for monitoring and troubleshooting
- **Climate Entity**: Provides a climate entity to view overall system status and set target temperature
- **Flexible Configuration**: Easy UI-based setup through Home Assistant config flow with options to reconfigure

### Cost Optimization (v1.7.0+)
- **Cheaper AI Models**: Support for Claude Haiku (85% cheaper) and GPT-4o Mini (85% cheaper)
- **Smart Skipping**: Automatically skips AI calls when all rooms are stable (within deadband)
- **AC-Off Optimization**: Skips AI calls when AC is off, reuses last recommendations
- **Potential Savings**: 70-90% reduction in AI API costs

### Advanced Features
- **Room Overrides**: Disable AI control for specific rooms while keeping others active
- **Heating/Cooling Modes**: Support for both heating and cooling with mode-aware optimizations
- **HVAC Mode Auto-Detection**: Can automatically detect heating/cooling from main climate entity
- **Hysteresis Control**: Prevents rapid AC on/off cycling with configurable thresholds
- **Startup Delay**: Grace period during Home Assistant startup to prevent false alarms
- **Persistent Notifications**: Optional notifications for important events (AC control, errors)

### Smart Automation Features (v1.8.0+)
- **Weather Integration**: Automatically adjusts target temperature based on outdoor conditions
  - Hot weather (>30°C): Sets AC slightly cooler to combat heat
  - Cold weather (<15°C): Sets AC slightly warmer to prevent overcooling
  - Supports weather entities and outdoor temperature sensors
- **Time-Based Scheduling**: Different target temperatures for different times and days
  - Multiple schedules with individual target temperatures
  - Day-of-week scheduling (weekdays, weekends, specific days, or all days)
  - Time range support including cross-midnight schedules (e.g., 22:00-08:00)
  - Schedule priority over base target temperature
- **Enhanced Overshoot Handling**: More aggressive fan shutoff for rooms that overshoot target
- **Improved Main Fan Logic**: Smarter thresholds for low/medium/high fan speeds

## How It Works

1. The integration monitors temperature sensors in each configured room
2. Every 5 minutes (configurable), it analyzes all room temperatures against the target
3. **Cost Optimization Checks**:
   - If all rooms are stable (within deadband) → Skip AI, reuse last recommendations
   - If AC is off → Skip AI, reuse last recommendations
   - If checks pass → Proceed with AI optimization
4. The AI determines optimal zone fan speeds to equalize temperatures:
   - **Too hot?** Increases zone fan speed (75-100%) to cool faster
   - **Too cold?** Decreases zone fan speed (25-50%) to reduce cooling
   - **At target?** Maintains balanced fan speeds (70-80%) across all zones
5. **Optional**: AI can also recommend optimal AC temperature setpoint
6. This creates a temperature equilibrium across your entire house
7. The system continuously adjusts to maintain the target temperature efficiently

### Main Aircon Fan Control Logic

When you configure a main aircon fan entity, the integration automatically adjusts the fan speed based on system conditions:

- **Low Fan Speed**: All rooms at or near target (≤1°C variance, ≤0.5°C average deviation)
  - System is maintaining temperature - minimal airflow needed

- **High Fan Speed**: Significant cooling needed (≥3°C max deviation OR ≥3°C variance)
  - Aggressive cooling required to bring rooms to target

- **Medium Fan Speed**: All other conditions
  - Moderate cooling or temperature equalization in progress

This ensures your main AC fan operates efficiently - running on low when just maintaining, and ramping up when aggressive cooling is needed.

### Automatic AC Control

#### AC On/Off Control

When enabled, the integration can automatically turn your main AC on/off:

**Turn On When:**
- Average room temperature ≥ target + 1.0°C (cooling mode)
- Average room temperature ≤ target - 1.0°C (heating mode)

**Turn Off When:**
- Average room temperature ≤ target - 2.0°C (cooling mode)
- Average room temperature ≥ target + 2.0°C (heating mode)

This hysteresis prevents rapid on/off cycling.

#### AC Temperature Control (Fully Automatic Mode)

When enabled, AI automatically sets your AC's temperature setpoint:

**Cooling Mode:**
- Aggressive cooling (rooms 2°C+ too hot): Sets AC to 18-20°C
- Moderate cooling (rooms 0.5-2°C too hot): Sets AC to 20-22°C
- Maintenance (rooms near target): Sets AC to 22-24°C

**Heating Mode:**
- Aggressive heating (rooms 2°C+ too cold): Sets AC to 24-26°C
- Moderate heating (rooms 0.5-2°C too cold): Sets AC to 22-24°C
- Maintenance (rooms near target): Sets AC to 20-22°C

### Automation Example

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Enable AI aircon management when home"
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: person.your_name
        to: "home"
    action:
      - service: climate.set_hvac_mode
        target:
          entity_id: climate.ai_aircon_manager
        data:
          hvac_mode: "auto"
      - service: climate.set_temperature
        target:
          entity_id: climate.ai_aircon_manager
        data:
          temperature: 22
```

## How the AI Management Works

The AI receives information about each room:
- Current temperature
- Target temperature
- Current zone fan speed

**The AI's strategy is to equalize temperatures across your entire house:**

### Cooling Mode

**Equalizing Phase (Different room temperatures):**
- **Rooms TOO HOT** (above target): AI sets zone fan to **HIGH** (75-100%)
  - Example: Bedroom is 25°C, target is 22°C → Set fan to 90%
- **Rooms TOO COLD** (below target): AI sets zone fan to **LOW** (25-50%)
  - Example: Living room is 20°C, target is 22°C → Set fan to 35%
- This redistributes cooling power to where it's needed most

**Maintenance Phase (All rooms near target):**
- **All rooms at target**: AI sets balanced fan speeds (70-80%) for all zones
- Makes small adjustments (±5-10%) to maintain equilibrium
- Prevents energy waste while keeping comfortable temperatures

### Heating Mode

**Equalizing Phase:**
- **Rooms TOO COLD** (below target): AI sets zone fan to **HIGH** (75-100%)
- **Rooms TOO WARM** (above target): AI sets zone fan to **LOW** (25-50%)
- Redistributes heating where needed

**Maintenance Phase:**
- Balanced fan speeds to maintain equilibrium

### Key Benefits
- **Smart redistribution**: Hot room gets 100% fan speed, cold room gets 25%
- **Whole-home balance**: Goal is entire house at desired temperature
- **Gradual adjustments**: Typically 10-25% changes to avoid overshooting
- **Continuous optimization**: Adapts to changing conditions throughout the day
- **Cost-aware**: Skips AI calls when not needed, saving money

## Troubleshooting

See [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for detailed troubleshooting steps.

### Common Issues

**Integration not appearing:**
- Ensure you've copied all files correctly
- Restart Home Assistant
- Check `custom_components/ai_aircon_manager/manifest.json` exists

**AI not making adjustments:**
- Check Home Assistant logs for errors
- Verify API key is valid
- Ensure zone fan controls are working (test manually first)
- Check "Last AI Optimization" sensor to see when AI last ran

**Duplicate entities with _2 suffix:**
- See TROUBLESHOOTING.md for detailed diagnostic steps
- Usually caused by multiple integration instances
- Check Settings → Devices & Services for duplicate entries

**AI running too frequently or not frequently enough:**
- Check "Next AI Optimization Time" sensor
- Enable debug logging to see timing checks
- Verify "Last AI Optimization" vs "Last Data Update Time"

**High API costs:**
- Switch to Haiku (Claude) or GPT-4o Mini (OpenAI) - 85% cheaper!
- Increase update interval (Settings → Configure → Change Settings)
- Increase temperature deadband for more stable periods

## Debug Logging

To enable detailed logging:

```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.ai_aircon_manager: debug
```
